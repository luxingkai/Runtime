    /*
     Much of object-oriented programming consists of writing the
     code for new objects -- defining new classes. In Objective-C,
     classes are defined in two parts:
     •  An interface that declares the methods and properties of
        the class and names its superclass
     •  An implementation that actually defines the class (contains
        the code that implements its methods)
     
     Each of these parts is typicaly in its own file. Sometimes,
     however, a class definition spans several files through the
     use of a feature called a category. Categories can
     compartmentalize a class definition or extend an existing
     one. Categories are described in Categories and Extensions.
     */
    
        
    
#pragma mark -- Source Files
    
    /*
     Although the compiler doesn’t require it, class interface
     and implementation are usually in two different files.
     The interface file must be made available to anyone who
     uses the class.

     A single file can declare or implement more than one class.
     Nevertheless, it’s customary to have a separate interface
     file for each class, if not also a separate implementation
     file. Keeping class interfaces separate better reflects
     their status as independent entities.

     Interface and implementation files typically are named
     after the class. The name of the implementation file has
     the .m extension, indicating that it contains Objective-C
     source code. The interface file can be assigned any other
     extension. Because it’s included in other source files,
     the name of the interface file usually has the .h extension
     typical of header files. For example, the Rectangle class
     would be declared in Rectangle.h and defined in Rectangle.m.

     Separating an object’s interface from its implementation
     fits well with the design of object-oriented programs.
     An object is a self-contained entity that can be viewed
     from the outside almost as a black box. Once you’ve
     determined how an object interacts with other elements
     in your program—that is, once you’ve declared its
     interface—you can freely alter its implementation without
     affecting any other part of the application.
     */
    

#pragma mark -- Class Interface
    
    /**
     The declaration of a class interface begins with the
     compiler directive @interface and ends with the directive
     @end. (All Objective-C directives to the compiler begin
     with “@”.)
     ====================================================
     @interface ClassName : ItsSuperclass
     // Method and property declarations.
     @end
     ====================================================
     
     The first line of the declaration presents the new class
     name and links it to its superclass. The superclass
     defines the position of the new class in the inheritance
     hierarchy, as discussed under Inheritance.

     Methods and properties for the class are declared next,
     before the end of the class declaration. The names of
     methods that can be used by class objects, class methods,
     are preceded by a plus sign:
     ====================================================
     + alloc;
     ====================================================

     The methods that instances of a class can use, instance
     methods, are marked with a minus sign:
     ====================================================
     - (void)display;
     ====================================================
     
     Although it’s not a common practice, you can define a
     class method and an instance method with the same name.
     A method can also have the same name as an instance
     variable, which is more common, especially if the method
     returns the value in the variable. For example, Circle
     has a radius method that could match a radius instance
     variable.

     Method return types are declared using the standard C
     syntax for casting one type to another:
     ====================================================
     - (float)radius;
     ====================================================

     Parameter types are declared in the same way:
     ====================================================
     - (void)setRadius:(float)aRadius;
     ====================================================
     
     If a return or parameter type isn’t explicitly declared,
     it’s assumed to be the default type for methods and
     messages—an id. The alloc method illustrated earlier
     returns id.

     When there’s more than one parameter, the parameters
     are declared within the method name after the colons.
     Parameters break the name apart in the declaration,
     just as in a message. For example:
     ====================================================
     - (void)setWidth:(float)width height:(float)height;
     ====================================================
     
     Methods that take a variable number of parameters
     declare them using a comma and ellipsis points,
     just as a function would:
     ====================================================
     - makeGroup:group, ...;
     ====================================================

     Property declarations take the form:
     ====================================================
     @property (attributes) Type propertyName;
     ====================================================
     
     Properties are discussed in more detail in Declared Properties.
     ⚠️ Historically, the interface required declarations
     of a class’s instance variables, the data structures
     that are part of each instance of the class. These
     were declared in braces after the @interface declaration
     and before method declarations:
     ====================================================
     @interface ClassName : ItsSuperclass
     {
         // Instance variable declarations.
     }
     // Method and property declarations.
     @end
     ====================================================
     Instance variables represent an implementation detail,
     and should typically not be accessed outside of the
     class itself. Moreover, you can declare them in the
     implementation block or synthesize them using declared
     properties. Typically you should not, therefore, declare
     instance variables in the public interface and so you
     should omit the braces.
     */
    
    /**
     Importing the Interface
     
     The interface file must be included in any source module
     that depends on the class interface—that includes any
     module that creates an instance of the class, sends a
     message to invoke a method declared for the class,
     or mentions an instance variable declared in the class.
     The interface is usually included with the #import directive:
     ====================================================
     #import "Rectangle.h"
     ====================================================
     
     This directive is identical to #include, except that
     it makes sure that the same file is never included
     more than once. It’s therefore preferred and is used
     in place of #include in code examples throughout
     Objective-C–based documentation.

     To reflect the fact that a class definition builds on
     the definitions of inherited classes, an interface file
     begins by importing the interface for its superclass:
     ====================================================
     #import "ItsSuperclass.h"
      
     @interface ClassName : ItsSuperclass
     // Method and property declarations.
     @end
     ====================================================
     
     This convention means that every interface file includes,
     indirectly, the interface files for all inherited classes.
     When a source module imports a class interface, it gets
     interfaces for the entire inheritance hierarchy that the
     class is built upon.

     Note that if there is a precomp—a precompiled header—that
     supports the superclass, you may prefer to import the
     precomp instead.
     */
    
    
    /**
     Referring to Other Classes
     
     An interface file declares a class and, by importing its
     superclass, implicitly contains declarations for all
     inherited classes, from NSObject on down through its
     superclass. If the interface mentions classes not in
     this hierarchy, it must import them explicitly or
     declare them with the @class directive:
     ====================================================
     @class Rectangle, Circle;
     ====================================================
     
     This directive simply informs the compiler that
     “Rectangle” and “Circle” are class names. It doesn’t
     import their interface files.

     An interface file mentions class names when it
     statically types instance variables, return values,
     and parameters. For example, this declaration
     ====================================================
     - (void)setPrimaryColor:(NSColor *)aColor;
     ====================================================
     
     mentions the NSColor class.

     Because declarations like this simply use the class
     name as a type and don’t depend on any details of
     the class interface (its methods and instance variables),
     the @class directive gives the compiler sufficient
     forewarning of what to expect. However, when the interface
     to a class is actually used (instances created, messages
     sent), the class interface must be imported. Typically,
     an interface file uses @class to declare classes, and
     the corresponding implementation file imports their
     interfaces (since it needs to create instances of those
     classes or send them messages).

     The @class directive minimizes the amount of code seen
     by the compiler and linker, and is therefore the
     simplest way to give a forward declaration of a class
     name. Being simple, it avoids potential problems that
     may come with importing files that import still other
     files. For example, if one class declares a statically
     typed instance variable of another class, and their
     two interface files import each other, neither class
     may compile correctly.
     */
    
    
    /**
     The Role of the Interface
     
     The purpose of the interface file is to declare the
     new class to other source modules (and to other
     programmers). It contains information they need to
     work with the class (programmers might also appreciate
     a little documentation).
     
     •  The interface file tells users how the class is
        connected into the inheritance hierarchy and what
        other classes—inherited or simply referred to somewhere
        in the class—are needed.
     •  Through its list of method declarations, the interface
        file lets other modules know what messages can be sent
        to the class object and instances of the class. Every
        method that can be used outside the class definition is
        declared in the interface file; methods that are internal
        to the class implementation can be omitted.
     */
    

    
#pragma mark -- Class Implementation

    
    /*
     The definition of a class is structured very much like its
     declaration. It begins with an @implementation directive
     and ends with the @end directive. In addition, the class
     may declare instance variables in braces after the
     @implementation directive:
     ====================================================
     @implementation ClassName
     {
         // Instance variable declarations.
     }
     // Method definitions.
     @end
     ====================================================
     
     Instance variables are often specified by declared
     properties (see Declared Properties). If you don’t
     declare additional instance variables, you can omit
     the braces:
     ====================================================
     @implementation ClassName
     // Method definitions.
     @end
     ====================================================
     
     ⚠️ Every implementation file must import its own
     interface. For example, Rectangle.m imports Rectangle.h.
     Because the implementation doesn’t need to repeat any of
     the declarations it imports, it can safely omit the name
     of the superclass.
     
     Methods for a class are defined, like C functions,
     within a pair of braces. Before the braces, they’re
     declared in the same manner as in the interface file,
     but without the semicolon. For example:
     ====================================================
     + (id)alloc {
         ...
     }
      
     - (BOOL)isFilled {
         ...
     }
      
     - (void)setFilled:(BOOL)flag {
         ...
     }
     ====================================================
     
     Methods that take a variable number of parameters handle
     them just as a function would:
     ====================================================
     #import <stdarg.h>
      
      ...
      
     - getGroup:group, ... {
      
         va_list ap;
         va_start(ap, group);
         ...
     }
     ====================================================
     */
    
    /**
     Referring to Instance Variables
     
     By default, the definition of an instance method has
     all the instance variables of the object within its
     scope. It can refer to them simply by name. Although
     the compiler creates the equivalent of C structures
     to store instance variables, the exact nature of the
     structure is hidden. You don’t need either of the
     structure operators (. or ->) to refer to an object’s
     data. For example, this method definition refers to
     the receiver’s filled instance variable:
     ====================================================
     - (void)setFilled:(BOOL)flag
     {
         filled = flag;
         ...
     }
     ====================================================
     
     Neither the receiving object nor its filled instance
     variable is declared as a parameter to this method,
     yet the instance variable falls within its scope.
     This simplification of method syntax is a significant
     shorthand in the writing of Objective-C code.

     When the instance variable belongs to an object
     that’s not the receiver, the object’s type must be
     made explicit to the compiler through static typing.
     In referring to the instance variable of a statically
     typed object, the structure pointer operator (->) is
     used.

     Suppose, for example, that the Sibling class declares
     a statically typed object, twin, as an instance variable:
     ====================================================
     @interface Sibling : NSObject
     {
         Sibling *twin;
         int gender;
         struct features *appearance;
     }
     ====================================================
     
     As long as the instance variables of the statically
     typed object are within the scope of the class (as
     they are here because twin is typed to the same class),
     a Sibling method can set them directly:
     ====================================================
     - makeIdenticalTwin
     {
         if ( !twin ) {
             twin = [[Sibling alloc] init];
             twin->gender = gender;
             twin->appearance = appearance;
         }
         return twin;
     }
     ====================================================
     */
    
    
    /**
     The Scope of Instance Variables
     
     To enforce the ability of an object to hide its data,
     the compiler limits the scope of instance variables—that
     is, limits their visibility within the program. But to
     provide flexibility, it also lets you explicitly set the
     scope at four levels. Each level is marked by a compiler
     directive:
     ====================================================
     @private
     The instance variable is accessible only within the class
     that declares it.
     ====================================================
     @protected
     The instance variable is accessible within the class that
     declares it and within classes that inherit it. All instance
     variables without an explicit scope directive have @protected
     scope.
     ====================================================
     @public
     The instance variable is accessible everywhere.
     ====================================================
     @package
     Using the modern runtime, an @package instance variable
     has @public scope inside the executable image that implements
     the class, but acts like @private outside.

     The @package scope for Objective-C instance variables is
     analogous to private_extern for C variables and functions.
     Any code outside the class implementation’s image that tries
     to use the instance variable gets a link error.

     This scope is most useful for instance variables in framework
     classes, where @private may be too restrictive but @protected
     or @public too permissive.
     ====================================================
     
     Figure 2-1 illustrates the levels of scoping.
     file:///Users/tigerfly/Desktop/Runtime/Runtime/scopeinstvariables.gif
     
     A scoping directive applies to all the instance variables
     listed after it, up to the next directive or the end of
     the list. In the following example, the age and evaluation
     instance variables are private; name, job, and wage are
     protected; and boss is public.
     ====================================================
     @interface Worker : NSObject
     {
         char *name;
     @private
         int age;
         char *evaluation;
     @protected
         id job;
         float wage;
     @public
         id boss;
     }
     ====================================================
     
     By default, all unmarked instance variables (like
     name above) are @protected.

     All instance variables that a class declares, no
     matter how they’re marked, are within the scope of
     the class definition. For example, a class that
     declares a job instance variable, such as the Worker
     class shown above, can refer to it in a method definition:
     ====================================================
     - promoteTo:newPosition
     {
         id old = job;
         job = newPosition;
         return old;
     }
     ====================================================
     
     Obviously, if a class couldn’t access its own instance
     variables, the instance variables would be of no use
     whatsoever.

     Normally, a class also has access to the instance
     variables it inherits. The ability to refer to an instance
     variable is usually inherited along with the variable.
     It makes sense for classes to have their entire data
     structures within their scope, especially if you think
     of a class definition as merely an elaboration of the
     classes it inherits from. The promoteTo: method illustrated
     earlier could just as well have been defined in any
     class that inherits the job instance variable from the
     Worker class.

     However, there are reasons why you might want to restrict
     inheriting classes from directly accessing an instance
     variable:
     
     •  Once a subclass accesses an inherited instance variable,
        the class that declares the variable is tied to that part
        of its implementation. In later versions, it can’t eliminate
        the variable or alter the role it plays without inadvertently
        breaking the subclass.
     •  Moreover, if a subclass accesses an inherited instance
        variable and alters its value, it may inadvertently
        introduce bugs in the class that declares the variable,
        especially if the variable is involved in class-internal
        dependencies.
     
     To limit an instance variable’s scope to just the class
     that declares it, you must mark it @private. Instance
     variables marked @private are only available to subclasses
     by calling public accessor methods, if they exist.

     At the other extreme, marking a variable @public makes
     it generally available, even outside of class definitions
     that inherit or declare the variable. Normally, to get
     information stored in an instance variable, other objects
     must send a message requesting it. However, a public instance
     variable can be accessed anywhere as if it were a field in
     a C structure. For example:
     ====================================================
     Worker *ceo = [[Worker alloc] init];
     ceo->boss = nil;
     ====================================================

     Note that the object must be statically typed.

     Marking instance variables @public defeats the ability
     of an object to hide its data. It runs counter to a
     fundamental principle of object-oriented programming—the
     encapsulation of data within objects where it’s protected
     from view and inadvertent error. Public instance variables
     should therefore be avoided except in extraordinary cases.
     */
    
    
    
#pragma mark -- Messages to self and super

    /*
     Objective-C provides two terms that can be used within
     a method definition to refer to the object that performs
     the method—self and super.

     Suppose, for example, that you define a reposition
     method that needs to change the coordinates of whatever
     object it acts on. It can invoke the setOrigin:: method
     to make the change. All it needs to do is send a setOrigin::
     message to the same object that the reposition message
     itself was sent to. When you’re writing the reposition
     code, you can refer to that object as either self or super.
     The reposition method could read either:
     ====================================================
     - reposition
     {
         ...
         [self setOrigin:someX :someY];
         ...
     }
     ====================================================
     
     or:
     ====================================================
     - reposition
     {
         ...
         [super setOrigin:someX :someY];
         ...
     }
     ====================================================

     Here, self and super both refer to the object receiving
     a reposition message, whatever object that may happen
     to be. The two terms are quite different, however. self
     is one of the hidden parameters that the messaging
     routine passes to every method; it’s a local variable
     that can be used freely within a method implementation,
     r in a message expression. As receivers, the two terms
     differ principally in how they affect the messaging
     process:

     •  self searches for the method implementation in the
        usual manner, starting in the dispatch table of the
        receiving object’s class. In the example above, it
        would begin with the class of the object receiving
        the reposition message.
     •  super is a flag that tells the compiler to search for
        the method implementation in a very different place.
        It begins in the superclass of the class that defines
        the method where super appears. In the example above,
        it would begin with the superclass of the class where
        reposition is defined.

     Wherever super receives a message, the compiler substitutes
     another messaging routine for the objc_msgSend function.
     The substitute routine looks directly to the superclass of
     the defining class—that is, to the superclass of the class
     sending the message to super—rather than to the class of
     the object receiving the message.
     */
    
    
    /**
     An Example: Using self and super
     
     The difference between self and super becomes clear
     when using a hierarchy of three classes. Suppose, for
     example, that we create an object belonging to a class
     called Low. The superclass of Low is Mid; the superclass
     of Mid is High. All three classes define a method called
     negotiate, which each class uses for its own purpose.
     In addition, Mid defines an ambitious method called
     makeLastingPeace, which itself employs the negotiate
     method. The classes and those methods are illustrated
     in Figure 2-2.
     
     Figure 2-2  The hierarchy of High, Mid, and Low
     file:///Users/tigerfly/Desktop/Runtime/Runtime/highmidlow.gif
     
     Suppose that the implementation of makeLastingPeace
     (in the Mid class) uses self to indicate the object
     to send the negotiate message to:
     ====================================================
     - makeLastingPeace
     {
         [self negotiate];
         ...
     }
     ====================================================
     
     When a message is sent to a Low object to perform the
     makeLastingPeace method, makeLastingPeace sends a negotiate
     message to the same Low object. The messaging routine finds
     the version of negotiate defined in Low, the class of self.

     However, if the implementation of makeLastingPeace instead
     uses super as the receiver,
     ====================================================
     - makeLastingPeace
     {
         [super negotiate];
         ...
     }
     ====================================================

     the messaging routine finds the version of negotiate
     defined in High. It ignores the class (Low) of the
     object that received the makeLastingPeace message and
     skips to the superclass of Mid, because Mid is where
     makeLastingPeace is defined. Neither implementation
     finds the Mid version of negotiate.

     As this example illustrates, super provides a way to
     bypass a method that overrides another method. Here,
     the use of super enabled makeLastingPeace to bypass
     the Mid version of negotiate that redefined the High
     version of that method.

     Not being able to reach the Mid version of negotiate,
     as just described, may seem like a flaw, but under the
     circumstances it’s intentional:
     •  The author of the Low class intentionally overrode
        the Mid version of negotiate so that instances of Low
        (and its subclasses) would invoke the redefined version
        of the method instead. The designer of Low didn’t want
        Low objects to perform the inherited method.
     •  The author of the Mid method makeLastingPeace, in
        sending the negotiate message to super (as shown in
        the second implementation), intentionally skipped over
        the Mid version of negotiate (and over any versions that
        might be defined in classes like Low that inherit from
        Mid) to perform the version defined in the High class.
        The designer of the second implementation of makeLastingPeace
        wanted to use the High version of negotiate and no other.
     
     The Mid version of negotiate could still be used, but it
     would take a direct message to a Mid instance to do so.

    /**
     Using super
     
     Messages to super allow method implementations to be
     distributed over more than one class. You can override
     an existing method to modify or add to it and still
     incorporate the original method in the modification:
     ====================================================
     - negotiate
     {
         ...
         return [super negotiate];
     }
     ====================================================
     
     For some tasks, each class in the inheritance hierarchy
     can implement a method that does part of the job and
     passes the message on to super for the rest. The init
     method, which initializes a newly allocated instance,
     is designed to work like this. Each init method has
     responsibility for initializing the instance variables
     defined in its class. But before doing so, it sends an
     init message to super to have the classes it inherits from
     initialize their instance variables. Each version of init
     follows this procedure, so classes initialize their
     instance variables in the order of inheritance:
     ====================================================
     - (id)init
     {
         self = [super init];
         if (self) {
             ...
         }
     }
     ====================================================

     It’s also possible to concentrate core functionality
     in one method defined in a superclass and have subclasses
     incorporate the method through messages to super. For
     example, every class method that creates an instance must
     allocate storage for the new object and initialize its
     isa variable to the class structure. Allocation is typically
     left to the alloc and allocWithZone: methods defined in the
     NSObject class. If another class overrides these methods
     (a rare case), it can still get the basic functionality
     by sending a message to super.

    /**
     Redefining self

     super is simply a flag to the compiler telling it where
     to begin searching for the method to perform; it’s used
     only as the receiver of a message. But self is a variable
     name that can be used in any number of ways, even
     assigned a new value.
     
     There’s a tendency to do just that in definitions of
     class methods. Class methods are often concerned not
     with the class object, but with instances of the class.
     For example, many class methods combine allocation and
     initialization of an instance, often setting up instance
     variable values at the same time. In such a method, it
     might be tempting to send messages to the newly allocated
     instance and to call the instance self, just as in an
     instance method. But that would be an error. self and
     super both refer to the receiving object—the object that
     gets a message telling it to perform the method. Inside
     an instance method, self refers to the instance; but
     inside a class method, self refers to the class object.
     This is an example of what not to do:
     ====================================================
     + (Rectangle *)rectangleOfColor:(NSColor *) color
     {
         self = [[Rectangle alloc] init]; // BAD
         [self setColor:color];
         return self;
     }
     ====================================================

     To avoid confusion, it’s usually better to use a variable
     other than self to refer to an instance inside a class method:
     ====================================================
     + (id)rectangleOfColor:(NSColor *)color
     {
         id newInstance = [[Rectangle alloc] init]; // GOOD
         [newInstance setColor:color];
         return newInstance;
     }
     ====================================================
     
     In fact, rather than sending the alloc message to the
     class in a class method, it’s often better to send alloc
     to self. This way, if the class is subclassed, and the
     rectangleOfColor: message is received by a subclass, the
     instance returned is the same type as the subclass (for
     example, the array method of NSArray is inherited by
     NSMutableArray).
     ====================================================
     + (id)rectangleOfColor:(NSColor *)color
     {
         id newInstance = [[self alloc] init]; // EXCELLENT
         [newInstance setColor:color];
         return newInstance;
     }
     ====================================================
