    /*
     In Objective-C, selector has two meanings, it can be used
     to refer simply to the name of a method when it's used in
     a source-code message to an object. It also, though, refers
     to the unique identifier that replaces the name when the
     source code is compiled. Compiled selectors are of type
     SEL. All methods with the same name have the same selector.
     You can use a selector to invoke a method on an object-
     this provides the basis for the implementation of the
     target-action design pattern in Cocoa.

    /**
     For efficiency, full ASCII names are not used as method
     selectors in compiled code. Instead, the compiler writes
     each method name into a table, then pairs the name with
     a unique identifier that represents the method at runtime.
     The runtime system makes sure each identifier is unique:
     No two selectors are the same, and all methods with the
     same name have the same selector.
     */
    
    /**
     SEL and @selector
     
     Compiled selectors are assigned to a special type, SEL, to
     distinguish them from other data. Valid selectors are
     never 0. You must let the system assign SEL identifiers
     to methods; it's futile to assign them arbitrarily.
     
     The @selector() directive lets you refer to the compiled
     selector, rather than to the full method name. Here, the
     selector for setWidth:height: is assigned to the
     setWidthHeight variable:
     ==========================================================
     SEL setWidthHeight;
     setWidthHeight = @selector(setWidth:height:);
     ==========================================================
     
     It’s most efficient to assign values to SEL variables at
     compile time with the @selector() directive. However, in
     some cases, you may need to convert a character string to
     a selector at runtime. You can do this with the
     NSSelectorFromString function:
     ==========================================================
     setWidthHeight = NSSelectorFromString(aBuffer);
     ==========================================================

     Conversion in the opposite direction is also possible.
     The NSStringFromSelector function returns a method name
     for a selector:
     ==========================================================
     NSString *method;
     method = NSStringFromSelector(setWidthHeight);
     ==========================================================
     */

    /**
     Methods and Selectors
     
     Compiled selectors identify method names, not method implementations.
     The display method for one class, for example, has the same
     selector as display methods defined in other classes. This is
     essential for polymorphism and dynamic binding; it lets you
     send the same message to receivers belonging to different classes.
     If there were one selector per method implementation, a message
     would be no different from a function call.
     
     A class method and an instance method with the same name are
     assigned the same selector. However, because of their separate
     domains, there's no confusion between the two. A class could
     define a display class method in addition to a display instance
     method.

    /**
     Method Return and Parameter Types
     
     The messaging routine has access to method implementations only
     through selectors, so it treats all methods with the same selector
     alike. It discovers the return type of a method, and the data
     types of its parameters, from the selector. Therefore, except for
     messages sent to statically typed receivers, dynamic binding requires
     all implementations of identically named methods to have the same
     return type and the same parameter types. (Statically typed receivers
     are an exception to this rule because the compiler can learn about
     the method implementation from the class type.)
     
     Although identically named class methods and instance methods
     are represented by the same selector, they can have different
     parameter types and return types.

#pragma mark -- Varying the Message at Runtime

    /*
     The performSelector:, performSelector:withObject:, and
     performSelector:withObject:withObject: methods, defined
     in the NSObject protocol, take SEL identifiers as their
     initial parameters. All three methods map directly into
     the messaging function. For example,
     
     ==========================================================
     [friend performSelector:@selector(gossipAbout:)
     withObject:aNeighbor];
     ==========================================================

     is equivalent to:
     ==========================================================
     [friend gossipAbout:aNeighbor];
     ==========================================================
     
     These methods make it possible to vary a message at runtime,
     just as it’s possible to vary the object that receives the
     message. Variable names can be used in both halves of a
     message expression:
     ==========================================================
     id   helper = getTheReceiver();
     SEL  request = getTheSelector();
     [helper performSelector:request];
     ==========================================================

     In this example, the receiver (helper) is chosen at runtime
     (by the fictitious getTheReceiver function), and the method
     the receiver is asked to perform (request) is also determined
     at runtime (by the equally fictitious getTheSelector function).

     ⚠️ performSelector: and its companion methods return an
     object of type id. If the method that’s performed returns
     a different type, it should be cast to the proper type.
     (However, casting doesn’t work for all types; the method
     should return a pointer or a type compatible with a pointer.)
     */
    
    
    
#pragma mark -- The Target-Action Design Pattern

    /*
     In its treatment of user-interface controls, AppKit makes
     good use of the ability to vary both the receiver and the
     message at runtime.

     NSControl objects are graphical devices that can be used
     to give instructions to an application. Most resemble
     real-world control devices such as buttons, switches,
     knobs, text fields, dials, menu items, and the like. In
     software, these devices stand between the application and
     the user. They interpret events coming from hardware
     devices such as the keyboard and mouse and translate
     them into application-specific instructions. For example,
     a button labeled “Find” would translate a mouse click into
     an instruction for the application to start searching for
     something.

     AppKit defines a template for creating control devices and
     defines a few off-the-shelf devices of its own. For
     example, the NSButtonCell class defines an object that
     you can assign to an NSMatrix instance and initialize
     with a size, a label, a picture, a font, and a keyboard
     shortcut. When the user clicks the button (or uses the
     keyboard shortcut), the NSButtonCell object sends a
     message instructing the application to do something.
     To do this, an NSButtonCell object must be initialized
     not just with an image, a size, and a label, but with
     directions on what message to send and who to send it to.
     Accordingly, an NSButtonCell instance can be initialized
     for an action message (the method selector it should use
     in the message it sends) and a target (the object that
     should receive the message).
     ==========================================================
     [myButtonCell setAction:@selector(reapTheWind:)];
     [myButtonCell setTarget:anObject];
     ==========================================================
     
     When the user clicks the corresponding button, the button
     cell sends the message using the NSObject protocol method
     performSelector:withObject:. All action messages take a
     single parameter, the id of the control device sending the
     message.

     If Objective-C didn’t allow the message to be varied,
     all NSButtonCell objects would have to send the same
     message; the name of the method would be frozen in the
     NSButtonCell source code. Instead of simply implementing
     a mechanism for translating user actions into action
     messages, button cells and other controls would have
     to constrain the content of the message. Constrained
     messaging would make it difficult for any object to
     respond to more than one button cell. There would either
     have to be one target for each button, or the target
     object would have to discover which button the message
     came from and act accordingly. Each time you rearranged
     the user interface, you would also have to reimplement
     the method that responds to the action message. An
     absence of dynamic messaging would create an unnecessary
     complication that Objective-C happily avoids.
     */
    
    
#pragma mark -- Avoiding Messaging Errors

    /**
     If an object receives a message to perform a method
     that isn’t in its repertoire, an error results. It’s
     the same sort of error as calling a nonexistent function.
     But because messaging occurs at runtime, the error often
     isn’t evident until the program executes.

     It’s relatively easy to avoid this error when the
     message selector is constant and the class of the
     receiving object is known. As you write your programs,
     you can make sure that the receiver is able to respond.
     If the receiver is statically typed, the compiler
     performs this test for you.

     However, if the message selector or the class of the
     receiver varies, it may be necessary to postpone this
     test until runtime. The respondsToSelector: method,
     defined in the NSObject class, tests whether a receiver
     can respond to a message. It takes the method selector
     as a parameter and returns whether the receiver has
     access to a method matching the selector:
     ==========================================================
     if ( [anObject respondsToSelector:@selector(setOrigin::)] )
         [anObject setOrigin:0.0 :0.0];
     else
         fprintf(stderr, "%s can’t be placed\n",
             [NSStringFromClass([anObject class]) UTF8String]);
     ==========================================================
     
     The respondsToSelector: runtime test is especially
     important when you send messages to objects that you
     don’t have control over at compile time. For example,
     if you write code that sends a message to an object
     represented by a variable that others can set, you should
     make sure the receiver implements a method that can
     respond to the message.

     ⚠️ An object can also arrange to have messages it receives
     forwarded to other objects if it doesn’t respond to them
     directly itself. In that case, from the caller’s perspective,
     the object appears to handle the message directly, even
     though it handles the message indirectly by forwarding it
     to another object. See Message Forwarding in Objective-C
     Runtime Programming Guide for more information.
