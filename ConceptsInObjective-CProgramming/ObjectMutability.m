     Cocoa objects are either mutable or immutable. You cannot
     change the encapsulated values of immutable objects; once
     such an object is created, the value it represents remains
     the same throughout the object's life. But you can change
     the encapsulated value of a mutable object at any time.
     The following sections explain the reasons for having mutable
     and immutable variants of an object type, describe the
     characteristics and side-effects of object mutability,
     and recommend how best to handle objects when their mutability
     is an issue.

#pragma mark -- Why Mutable and Immutable Object Variants?
    
    /**
     Objects by default are mutable. Most objects allow
     you to change their encapsulated data through setter
     accessor methods. For example, you can change the size,
     positioning, title, buffering behavior, and other
     characteristics of an NSWindow object. A well-designed
     model object—say, an object representing a customer
     record—requires setter methods to change its instance data.

     The Foundation framework adds some nuance to this
     picture by introducing classes that have mutable and
     immutable variants. The mutable subclasses are typically
     subclasses of their immutable superclass and have “Mutable”
     embedded in the class name. These classes include the following:
     ================================================
     NSMutableArray
     NSMutableDictionary
     NSMutableSet
     NSMutableIndexSet
     NSMutableCharacterSet
     NSMutableData
     NSMutableString
     NSMutableAttributedString
     NSMutableURLRequest
     ================================================

     ⚠️ Except for NSMutableParagraphStyle in the AppKit framework,
     the Foundation framework currently defines all explicitly
     named mutable classes. However, any Cocoa framework can
     potentially have its own mutable and immutable class variants.
     
     Although these classes have atypical names, they are closer
     to the mutable norm than their immutable counterparts. Why
     this complexity? What purpose does having an immutable variant
     of a mutable object serve?

     Consider a scenario where all objects are capable of being
     mutated. In your application you invoke a method and are
     handed back a reference to an object representing a string.
     You use this string in your user interface to identify a
     particular piece of data. Now another subsystem in your
     application gets its own reference to that same string
     and decides to mutate it. Suddenly your label has changed
     out from under you. Things can become even more dire if,
     for instance, you get a reference to an array that you
     use to populate a table view. The user selects a row
     corresponding to an object in the array that has been
     removed by some code elsewhere in the program, and problems
     ensue. Immutability is a guarantee that an object won’t
     unexpectedly change in value while you’re using it.

     Objects that are good candidates for immutability are ones
     that encapsulate collections of discrete values or contain
     values that are stored in buffers (which are themselves
     kinds of collections, either of characters or bytes). But
     not all such value objects necessarily benefit from having
     mutable versions. Objects that contain a single simple value,
     such as instances of NSNumber or NSDate, are not good
     candidates for mutability. When the represented value
     changes in these cases, it makes more sense to replace
     the old instance with a new instance.

     Performance is also a reason for immutable versions of
     objects representing things such as strings and dictionaries.
     Mutable objects for basic entities such as strings and
     dictionaries bring some overhead with them. Because they
     must dynamically manage a changeable backing store—allocating
     and deallocating chunks of memory as needed—mutable objects
     can be less efficient than their immutable counterparts.

     Although in theory immutability guarantees that an object’s
     value is stable, in practice this guarantee isn’t always
     assured. A method may choose to hand out a mutable object
     under the return type of its immutable variant; later, it
     may decide to mutate the object, possibly violating
     assumptions and choices the recipient has made based on
     the earlier value. The mutability of an object itself may
     change as it undergoes various transformations. For example,
     serializing a property list (using the
     NSPropertyListSerialization class) does not preserve the
     mutability aspect of objects, only their general kind—a
     dictionary, an array, and so on. Thus, when you deserialize
     this property list, the resulting objects might not be of
     the same class as the original objects. For instance,
     what was once an NSMutableDictionary object might now be
     a NSDictionary object.
     */
    

#pragma mark -- Programming with Mutable Objects

    /*
     When the mutability of objects is an issue, it’s best
     to adopt some defensive programming practices. Here are
     a few general rules or guidelines:

     •  Use a mutable variant of an object when you need to
        modify its contents frequently and incrementally after
        it has been created.
     •  Sometimes it’s preferable to replace one immutable
        object with another; for example, most instance variables
        that hold string values should be assigned immutable
        NSString objects that are replaced with setter methods.
     •  Rely on the return type for indications of mutability.
     •  If you have any doubts about whether an object is, or
        should be, mutable, go with immutable.
     
     This section explores the gray areas in these guidelines,
     discussing typical choices you have to make when programming
     with mutable objects. It also gives an overview of methods
     in the Foundation framework for creating mutable objects
     and for converting between mutable and immutable object
     variants.
     */
    
    /**
     Creating and Converting Mutable Objects
     
     You can create a mutable object through the standard
     nested alloc-init message—for example:
     ================================================
     NSMutableDictionary *mutDict = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
     ================================================
     
     However, many mutable classes offer initializers and
     factory methods that let you specify the initial or
     probable capacity of the object, such as the arrayWithCapacity:
     class method of NSMutableArray:
     ================================================
     NSMutableArray *mutArray = [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity:[timeZones count]];
     ================================================
     
     The capacity hint enables more efficient storage of the
     mutable object’s data. (Because the convention for class
     factory methods is to return autoreleased instances, be
     sure to retain the object if you wish to keep it viable
     in your code.)

     You can also create a mutable object by making a mutable
     copy of an existing object of that general type. To do
     so, invoke the mutableCopy method that each immutable
     super class of a Foundation mutable class implements:
     ================================================
     NSMutableSet *mutSet = [aSet mutableCopy];
     ================================================

     In the other direction, you can send copy to a mutable
     object to make an immutable copy of the object.

     Many Foundation classes with immutable and mutable variants
     include methods for converting between the variants, including:
     
     •  typeWithType:—for example, arrayWithArray:
     •  setType:—for example, setString: (mutable classes only)
     •  initWithType:copyItems:—for example, initWithDictionary:copyItems:
     */
    
    /**
     Storing and Returning Mutable Instance Variables
     
     In Cocoa development you often have to decide whether
     to make an instance variable mutable or immutable.
     For an instance variable whose value can change, such
     as a dictionary or string, when is it appropriate to
     make the object mutable? And when is it better to make
     the object immutable and replace it with another object
     when its represented value changes?

     Generally, when you have an object whose contents change
     wholesale, it’s better to use an immutable object. Strings
     (NSString) and data objects (NSData) usually fall into
     this category. If an object is likely to change incrementally,
     it is a reasonable approach to make it mutable. Collections
     such as arrays and dictionaries fall into this category.
     However, the frequency of changes and the size of the
     collection should be factors in this decision. For example,
     if you have a small array that seldom changes, it’s better
     to make it immutable.

     There are a couple of other considerations when deciding
     on the mutability of a collection held as an instance
     variable:
     •  If you have a mutable collection that is frequently
        changed and that you frequently hand out to clients
        (that is, you return it directly in a getter accessor
        method), you run the risk of mutating something that
        your clients might have a reference to. If this risk
        is probable, the instance variable should be immutable.
     •  If the value of the instance variable frequently changes
        but you rarely return it to clients in getter methods,
        you can make the instance variable mutable but return an
        immutable copy of it in your accessor method; in memory-managed
        programs, this object would be autoreleased (Listing 9-1).
     ================================================
     Listing 9-1  Returning an immutable copy of a mutable instance variable

     @interface MyClass : NSObject {
         // ...
         NSMutableSet *widgets;
     }
     // ...
     @end
      
     @implementation MyClass
     - (NSSet *)widgets {
         return (NSSet *)[[widgets copy] autorelease];
     }
     ================================================

     One sophisticated approach for handling mutable collections
     that are returned to clients is to maintain a flag that
     records whether the object is currently mutable or immutable.
     If there is a change, make the object mutable and apply the
     change. When handing out the collection, make the object
     immutable (if necessary) before returning it.
     */
    
    /**
     Receiving Mutable Objects
     
     The invoker of a method is interested in the mutability
     of a returned object for two reasons:

     •  It wants to know if it can change the object’s value.
     •  It wants to know if the object’s value will change
        unexpectedly while it has a reference to it.

     Use Return Type, Not Introspection
     
     To determine whether it can change a received object,
     the receiver of a message must rely on the formal type
     of the return value. If it receives, for example, an
     array object typed as immutable, it should not attempt
     to mutate it. It is not an acceptable programming
     practice to determine if an object is mutable based on
     its class membership—for example:
     ================================================
     if ( [anArray isKindOfClass:[NSMutableArray class]] ) {
         // add, remove objects from anArray
     }
     ================================================

     For reasons related to implementation, what isKindOfClass:
     returns in this case may not be accurate. But for reasons
     other than this, you should not make assumptions about
     whether an object is mutable based on class membership.
     Your decision should be guided solely by what the
     signature of the method vending the object says about
     its mutability. If you are not sure whether an object
     is mutable or immutable, assume it’s immutable.
     
     A couple of examples might help clarify why this
     guideline is important:

     •  You read a property list from a file. When the
        Foundation framework processes the list, it notices
        that various subsets of the property list are identical,
        so it creates a set of objects that it shares among all
        those subsets. Afterward you look at the created property
        list objects and decide to mutate one subset. Suddenly,
        and without being aware of it, you’ve changed the tree in
        multiple places.
     •  You ask NSView for its subviews (with the subviews
        method) and it returns an object that is declared to
        be an NSArray but which could be an NSMutableArray
        internally. Then you pass that array to some other
        code that, through introspection, determines it to be
        mutable and changes it. By changing this array, the code
        is mutating internal data structures of the NSView class.
     
     So don’t make an assumption about object mutability
     based on what introspection tells you about an object.
     Treat objects as mutable or not based on what you are
     handed at the API boundaries (that is, based on the
     return type). If you need to unambiguously mark an
     object as mutable or immutable when you pass it to
     clients, pass that information as a flag along with
     the object.
     
     
     Make Snapshots of Received Objects
     If you want to ensure that a supposedly immutable
     object received from a method does not mutate without
     your knowing about it, you can make snapshots of the
     object by copying it locally. Then occasionally compare
     the stored version of the object with the most recent
     version. If the object has mutated, you can adjust
     anything in your program that is dependent on the
     previous version of the object. Listing 9-2 shows a
     possible implementation of this technique.
     ================================================
     Listing 9-2  Making a snapshot of a potentially mutable object
     static NSArray *snapshot = nil;
     - (void)myFunction {
         NSArray *thingArray = [otherObj things];
         if (snapshot) {
             if ( ![thingArray isEqualToArray:snapshot] ) {
                 [self updateStateWith:thingArray];
             }
         }
         snapshot = [thingArray copy];
     }
     ================================================
     
     A problem with making snapshots of objects for later
     comparison is that it is expensive. You’re required
     to make multiple copies of the same object. A more
     efficient alternative is to use key-value observing.
     See Key-Value Observing Programming Guide for a description
     of this protocol.
     */
    
    
    /**
     Mutable Objects in Collections
     
     Storing mutable objects in collection objects can cause
     problems. Certain collections can become invalid or even
     corrupt if objects they contain mutate because, by mutating,
     these objects can affect the way they are placed in the
     collection. First, the properties of objects that are keys
     in hashing collections such as NSDictionary objects or
     NSSet objects will, if changed, corrupt the collection
     if the changed properties affect the results of the
     object’s hash or isEqual: methods. (If the hash method
     of the objects in the collection does not depend on
     their internal state, corruption is less likely.)
     Second, if an object in an ordered collection such as
     a sorted array has its properties changed, this might
     affect how the object compares to other objects in the
     array, thus rendering the ordering invalid.
