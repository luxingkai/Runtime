    /*
     Although delegation, bindings, and notifications are useful
     for handling certain forms of communication between objects
     in a program, they are not particularly suitable for the most
     visible sort of communication. A typical application's user
     interface consists of a number of graphical objects, and
     perhaps the most common of these objects are controls. A
     control is a graphical analog of a real-world or logical
     device (button, slider, checkboxes, and so on); as with
     a real-world control, such as a radio tuner, you use it
     to convey your intent to some system of which it is a part
     -- that is, an application.
     
     The role of a control on a user interface is simple: it
     interprets the intent of the user and instructs some other
     object to carry out that request. When a user acts on the
     control by, say, clicking it or pressing the Return key,
     the hardware device generates a raw event. The control
     accepts the event (as appropriately packaged for Cocoa)
     and translates it into an instruction that is specific
     to the application. However, events by themselves don't
     give much information about the user's intent; they
     merely tell you that the user clicked a mouse button
     or pressed a key. So some mechanism must be called upon
     to provide the translation between event and instruction.
     This mechanism is called target-action.
     
     Cocoa uses the target-action mechanism for communication
     between a control and another object. This mechanism allows
     the control and, in OS X its cell or cells, to encapsulate
     the information necessary to send an application-specific
     instruction to the appropriate object. The receiving object
     -- typically an instance of a custom class -- is called
     the target. The action is the message that the control
     sends to the target. The object that is interested in
     the user event -- the target -- is the one that imparts
     significance to it, and this significance is usually
     reflected in the name it gives to the action.
     */
    
    
#pragma mark -- The Target
    
    /**
     A target is a receiver of an action message. A control or,
     more frequently, its cell holds the target of its action
     message as an outlet (see Outlets). The target usually is
     an instance of one of your custom classes, although it
     can be any Cocoa object whose class implements the
     appropriate action method.

     You can also set a cell’s or control’s target outlet
     to nil and let the target object be determined at runtime.
     When the target is nil, the application object
     (NSApplication or UIApplication) searches for an
     appropriate receiver in a prescribed order:
     
     1. It begins with the first responder in the key window
        and follows nextResponder links up the responder chain
        to the window object’s (NSWindow or UIWindow) content view.
        ⚠️ A key window in OS X responds to key presses for an
            application and is the receiver of messages from menus
            and dialogs. An application’s main window is the principal
            focus of user actions and often has key status as well.
     2. It tries the window object and then the window object’s delegate.
     3. If the main window is different from the key window, it
        then starts over with the first responder in the main window
        and works its way up the main window’s responder chain to
        the window object and its delegate.
     4. Next, the application object tries to respond. If it can’t
        respond, it tries its delegate. The application object and
        its delegate are the receivers of last resort.

     Control objects do not (and should not) retain their targets.
     However, clients of controls sending action messages
     (applications, usually) are responsible for ensuring that
     their targets are available to receive action messages.
     To do this, they may have to retain their targets in
     memory-managed environments. This precaution applies
     equally to delegates and data sources.

#pragma mark -- The Action

    /**
     An action is the message a control sends to the target
     or, from the perspective of the target, the method the
     target implements to respond to the action message. A
     control or—as is frequently the case in AppKit—a control’s
     cell stores an action as an instance variable of type
     SEL. SEL is an Objective-C data type used to specify the
     signature of a message. An action message must have a
     simple, distinct signature. The method it invokes returns
     nothing and usually has a sole parameter of type id. This
     parameter, by convention, is named sender. Here is an
     example from the NSResponder class, which defines a number
     of action methods:
     ================================================
     - (void)capitalizeWord:(id)sender;
     ================================================

     Action methods declared by some Cocoa classes can also
     have the equivalent signature:
     ================================================
     - (IBAction) deleteRecord:(id)sender;
     ================================================

     In this case, IBAction does not designate a data type
     for a return value; no value is returned. IBAction is a
     type qualifier that Interface Builder notices during
     application development to synchronize actions added
     programmatically with its internal list of action methods
     defined for a project.

     ⚠️ In UIKit, action selectors can also take two other forms.
     See Target-Action in UIKit for details.

     The senderparameter usually identifies the control sending
     the action message (although it can be another object
     substituted by the actual sender). The idea behind this
     is similar to a return address on a postcard. The target
     can query the sender for more information if it needs to.
     If the actual sending object substitutes another object
     as sender, you should treat that object in the same way.
     For example, say you have a text field and when the user
     enters text, the action method nameEntered: is invoked
     in the target:
     ================================================
     - (void)nameEntered:(id) sender {
         NSString *name = [sender stringValue];
         if (![name isEqualToString:@""]) {
             NSMutableArray *names = [self nameList];
             [names addObject:name];
             [sender setStringValue:@""];
         }
     }
     ================================================

     Here the responding method extracts the contents of
     the text field, adds the string to an array cached
     as an instance variable, and clears the field. Other
     possible queries to the sender would be asking an
     NSMatrix object for its selected row ([sender selectedRow]),
     asking an NSButton object for its state ([sender state]),
     and asking any cell associated with a control for its
     tag ([[sender cell] tag]), a tag being a numeric identifier.

#pragma mark -- Target-Action in the AppKit Framework

    /*
     The AppKit framework uses specific architectures and
     conventions in implementing target-action.
     */
    
    /**
     Controls, Cells, and Menu Items

     Most controls in AppKit are objects that inherit
     from the NSControl class. Although a control has
     the initial responsibility for sending an action
     message to its target, it rarely carries the
     information needed to send the message. For this,
     it usually relies on its cell or cells.

     A control almost always has one or more cells—objects
     that inherit from NSCell—associated with it. Why is
     there this association? A control is a relatively
     “heavy” object because it inherits all the combined
     instance variables of its ancestors, which include
     the NSView and NSResponder classes. Because controls
     are expensive, cells are used to subdivide the
     screen real estate of a control into various functional
     areas. Cells are lightweight objects that can be
     thought of as overlaying all or part of the control.
     But it's not only a division of area, it's a division
     of labor. Cells do some of the drawing that controls
     would otherwise have to do, and cells hold some of the
     data that controls would otherwise have to carry. Two
     items of this data are the instance variables for
     target and action. Figure 12-1 depicts the control-cell
     architecture.

     Being abstract classes, NSControl and NSCell both
     incompletely handle the setting of the target and
     action instance variables. By default, NSControl
     simply sets the information in its associated cell,
     if one exists. (NSControl itself supports only a
     one-to-one mapping between itself and a cell; subclasses
     of NSControl such as NSMatrix support multiple cells.)
     In its default implementation, NSCell simply raises an
     exception. You must go one step further down the
     inheritance chain to find the class that really implements
     the setting of target and action: NSActionCell.

     Objects derived from NSActionCell provide target and
     action values to their controls so the controls can
     compose and send an action message to the proper
     receiver. An NSActionCell object handles mouse (cursor)
     tracking by highlighting its area and assisting its
     control in sending action messages to the specified
     target. In most cases, the responsibility for an
     NSControl object’s appearance and behavior is completely
     given over to a corresponding NSActionCell object.
     (NSMatrix, and its subclass NSForm, are subclasses of
     NSControl that don’t follow this rule.)
     
     Figure 12-1  How the target-action mechanism works in
     the control-cell architecture
     file:///Users/tigerfly/Desktop/Runtime/ConceptsInObjective-CProgramming/target_action.gif
     
     When users choose an item from a menu, an action is sent
     to a target. Yet menus (NSMenu objects) and their items
     (NSMenuItem objects) are completely separate, in an
     architectural sense, from controls and cells. The
     NSMenuItem class implements the target-action mechanism
     for its own instances; an NSMenuItem object has both
     target and action instance variables (and related
     accessor methods) and sends the action message to the
     target when a user chooses it.
     */
    
    /**
     Setting the Target and Action
     
     You can set the targets and actions of cells and
     controls programmatically or by using Interface
     Builder. For most developers and most situations,
     Interface Builder is the preferred approach. When
     you use it to set controls and targets, Interface
     Builder provides visual confirmation, allows you to
     lock the connections, and archives the connections
     to a nib file. The procedure is simple:
     
     1. Declare an action method in the header file of
        your custom class that has the IBAction qualifier.
     2. In Interface Builder, connect the control sending
        the message to the action method of the target.
     
     If the action is handled by a superclass of your custom
     class or by an off-the-shelf AppKit or UIKit class, you
     can make the connection without declaring any action
     method. Of course, if you declare an action method
     yourself, you must be sure to implement it.

     To set the action and the target programmatically,
     use the following methods to send messages to a control
     or cell object:
     ================================================
     - (void)setTarget:(id)anObject;
     - (void)setAction:(SEL)aSelector;
     ================================================
     
     The following example shows how you might use these methods:
     ================================================
     [aCell setTarget:myController];
     [aControl setAction:@selector(deleteRecord:)];
     [aMenuItem setAction:@selector(showGuides:)]
     ================================================

     Programmatically setting the target and action does
     have its advantages and in certain situations it is
     the only possible approach. For example, you might
     want the target or action to vary according to some
     runtime condition, such as whether a network connection
     exists or whether an inspector window has been loaded.
     Another example is when you are dynamically populating
     the items of a pop-up menu, and you want each pop-up
     item to have its own action.
     */
    
    /**
     Actions Defined by AppKit
     
     The AppKit framework not only includes many
     NSActionCell-based controls for sending action
     messages, it defines action methods in many of
     its classes. Some of these actions are connected
     to default targets when you create a Cocoa application
     project. For example, the Quit command in the
     application menu is connected to the terminate: method
     in the global application object (NSApp).

     The NSResponder class also defines many default
     action messages (also known as standard commands)
     for common operations on text. This allows the
     Cocoa text system to send these action messages
     up an application’s responder chain—a hierarchical
     sequence of event-handling objects—where it can be
     handled by the first NSView, NSWindow, or NSApplication
     object that implements the corresponding method.
     */
    
    
    
#pragma mark -- Target-Action in UIKit

    /*
     The UIKit framework also declares and implements a
     suite of control classes; the control classes in
     this framework inherit from the UIControl class,
     which defines most of the target-action mechanism
     for iOS. However there are some fundamental differences
     in how the AppKit and UIKit frameworks implement
     target-action. One of these differences is that UIKit
     does not have any true cell classes. Controls in UIKit
     do not rely upon their cells for target and action
     information.

     A larger difference in how the two frameworks implement
     target-action lies in the nature of the event model.
     In the AppKit framework, the user typically uses a mouse
     and keyboard to register events for handling by the
     system. These events—such as clicking on a button—are
     limited and discrete. Consequently, a control object in
     AppKit usually recognizes a single physical event as the
     trigger for the action it sends to its target. (In the
     case of buttons, this is a mouse-up event.) In iOS, the
     user’s fingers are what originate events instead of mouse
     clicks, mouse drags, or physical keystrokes. There can be
     more than one finger touching an object on the screen at
     one time, and these touches can even be going in different
     directions.

     To account for this multitouch event model, UIKit declares
     a set of control-event constants in UIControl.h that
     specify various physical gestures that users can make on
     controls, such as lifting a finger from a control,
     dragging a finger into a control, and touching down
     within a text field. You can configure a control object
     so that it responds to one or more of these touch events
     by sending an action message to a target. Many of the
     control classes in UIKit are implemented to generate
     certain control events; for example, instances of the
     UISlider class generate a UIControlEventValueChanged
     control event, which you can use to send an action
     message to a target object.

     You set up a control so that it sends an action message
     to a target object by associating both target and action
     with one or more control events. To do this, send
     addTarget:action:forControlEvents: to the control for
     each target-action pair you want to specify. When the
     user touches the control in a designated fashion, the
     control forwards the action message to the global
     UIApplication object in a sendAction:to:from:forEvent:
     message. As in AppKit, the global application object is
     the centralized dispatch point for action messages.
     If the control specifies a nil target for an action
     message, the application queries objects in the
     responder chain until it finds one that is willing to
     handle the action message—that is, one implementing
     a method corresponding to the action selector.
     
     In contrast to the AppKit framework, where an action
     method may have only one or perhaps two valid signatures,
     the UIKit framework allows three different forms of
     action selector:
     ================================================
     - (void)action
     - (void)action:(id)sender
     - (void)action:(id)sender forEvent:(UIEvent *)event
     ================================================

     UIKit, read UIControl Class Reference.
